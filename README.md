# Face Recognition using Matplotlib, OpenCV (cv2), and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

This project is a face recognition system built using Python and popular libraries such as Matplotlib, OpenCV (cv2), and the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file. The aim of this project is to detect and recognize faces in images or video streams, providing a foundation for various applications like automated attendance systems, security systems, and more.

## Features
Face detection in images or video streams
Face recognition for known individuals (with additional setup)
Visualizing detected faces using Matplotlib

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to have the following installed:

Python (3.6 or above)
Matplotlib (install using pip install matplotlib)
OpenCV (cv2) (install using pip install opencv-python)
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file (download from here)

## Usage
1.Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/face-recognition.git

2.Place the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file in the project directory.

3.Run the face_recognition.py script:

python face_recognition.py

## How it Works
The face recognition system uses the Haar-like features-based cascade classifiers provided by OpenCV. These classifiers are pre-trained to detect frontal faces, and the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file contains the required data for face detection. The script uses this file to identify faces in the provided image or video stream.

For face recognition of known individuals, you would need to implement additional functionality, such as a machine learning-based classifier or a deep learning model trained on a face dataset.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the functionality, please feel free to create a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the OpenCV team for providing the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file, which is crucial for face detection in this project.
